# Gas-Guard AI (Gas-Guardian)

Welcome! This repository contains Gas-Guard AI — a full-stack project that monitors blockchain gas prices, runs predictive models to help optimize transaction timing, and provides a web dashboard and AI assistant to help users make cost-effective decisions.

**Quick summary:**
- Purpose: Real-time gas monitoring + AI predictions for the Flare network (and similar EVM chains).
- Components: Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript), Backend (Node.js + Express + Prisma), Smart Contracts (Hardhat), AI utilities (Python scripts).

**Project highlights**
- Real-time gas price fetching and monitoring (services in `backend/src/jobs`).
- AI model training and prediction pipelines (scripts in `backend/src/jobs` and `gas_fee_monitor.py`).
- Frontend UI with charts, chat assistant, and wallet integration (React components in `src/components`).
- Smart contract layer in `contracts/` with Hardhat scripts and tests.

**Flare technologies used (what this project relies on)**
This project intentionally uses Flare's native data and oracle services — not just generic chain nodes — so the features here reflect real Flare integrations:

- FTSOv2: We query Flare's FTSOv2 oracle data to obtain on-chain price and gas-related signals. FTSOv2 is used as a primary oracle to inform predictions and timing suggestions.
- FDC (Flare Data Connector): We use FDC feeds and connectors to gather cross-chain and historical data for comparison between chains and for richer context when generating AI-driven recommendations.
- FAssets: The project is compatible with and aware of FAssets; where relevant we surface FAsset data in analytics and charts.
- Flare Smart Accounts: The stack supports interaction patterns and UX designed for Flare Smart Accounts where applicable.

In short: the app pulls gas and oracle signals directly from Flare services (FTSOv2, FDC, etc.), uses those feeds to power monitoring and prediction, and surfaces that information in the dashboard.

**Repository layout (important parts)**
- `README.md` — you are here.
- `src/` — frontend app (Vite + React + TypeScript).
- `backend/` — backend API (TypeScript + Express + Prisma). Key files:
  - `backend/src/server.ts` — app entry
  - `backend/src/jobs/` — background jobs (pollers, fetchers, trainers)
  - `backend/src/services/` — core backend services
  - `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` — database schema
- `contracts/` — Solidity contracts, tests, and Hardhat scripts.

**Prerequisites (recommendations)**
- Node.js 18+ and `npm` (or `pnpm`/`yarn`) installed.
- Python 3.8+ (if you want to run the Python scripts / model training).
- Git and a Web3 Wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with local or testnet deployments.
- Optional: Docker & Docker Compose for running services in containers.

## Quickstart (Development) — Windows PowerShell
These commands assume you are in the repo root (`gas-guardian-ai-main`).

1) Clone and install frontend deps
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/JAGADISHSUNILPEDNEKAR/gas-guardian-ai-main.git
cd "gas-guardian-ai-main"
npm install
```

2) Start the frontend dev server (Vite)
```powershell
npm run dev
```

3) Open a separate terminal to start the backend
```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Root `npm run dev` runs the frontend (`vite`).
- Backend dev uses `tsx watch src/server.ts` as defined in `backend/package.json`.

---

## Backend: setup, Prisma, and env variables
Location: `backend/`

1) Install dependencies and generate Prisma client
```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run generate
```

2) Migrate (development)
Ensure you set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` first. Example local SQLite or Postgres URL.
```powershell
# copy example env if present
if (Test-Path .env.example) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }

# run migrations
npm run migrate
```

3) Typical environment variables (place in `backend/.env`):
- `DATABASE_URL` — Prisma database connection string (e.g., `file:./dev.db` or Postgres URL)
- `PORT` — server port (default usually 3000 or 4000)
- `JWT_SECRET` — for auth tokens
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — if using OpenAI features
- `PRIVATE_KEY` or `MNEMONIC` — for contract deploy scripts (keep secrets safe)

Check `backend/src/config` for exact env keys used by the server.

---

## Smart Contracts (Hardhat)
Location: `contracts/` (root also has Hardhat config)

Commands (from repo root):
```powershell
# run hardhat tests (root `test` script calls hardhat test)
npm run test

# or inside contracts folder
cd contracts
npm install
npm test

# compile
npm run compile

# run a local Hardhat node
npm run node

# deploy to testnet (example from root scripts)
npm run deploy:coston2
# or
npm run deploy:flare
```

Note: Deployment scripts call `scripts/deploy/deployGasGuard.cjs` using `hardhat.config.cjs`. Make sure your deploy env vars (RPC URL, private key) are set.

---


## Docker / Local multi-service (infra)
The `infra/docker` folder contains `Dockerfile.backend`, `Dockerfile.frontend`, and `docker-compose.yml` for running the stack in containers.

To run via Docker Compose (example):
```powershell
cd infra/docker
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and start services. Check `docker-compose.yml` for mapped ports and environment variables.

---

## Testing and linting
- Frontend lint: `npm run lint` (root) — runs ESLint across project.
- Backend tests: `cd backend && npm test` (uses `jest` if tests exist).
- Contracts tests: `npm run test` (root) runs `hardhat test` via `test:contracts`.

Suggested test workflow:
1. Run contract tests: `npm run test` (root)
2. Run backend unit tests: `cd backend && npm test`

---

## Troubleshooting & common notes
- If you see Prisma errors, make sure `DATABASE_URL` is correct and run `npx prisma generate`.
- If Hardhat can't find a network RPC, verify your RPC URL env variables and the `hardhat.config.cjs` file.
- Sensitive keys: NEVER commit private keys or `.env` files to git. Use environment variables or secrets manager.
- If the frontend can't connect to backend, ensure `backend` server `PORT` is reachable and the frontend `api` base URL is configured.

Where to look in code:
- Prisma schema: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Server entry: `backend/src/server.ts`
- Frontend entry: `src/main.tsx`
- Contract source: `contracts/core/GasGuard.sol`

---

## Contributing
- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, write tests, and open a pull request.
- Use the existing code style and run linters before opening a PR: `npm run lint`.

If you add or update env variables, include `.env.example` updates and document the change in this README.

If you'd like, I can also:
- run the tests locally and report failures,
- add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a PR checklist,
- or prepare a simple `docker-compose.override.yml` tuned for local dev.
